  - [Tonic](https://github.com/mmajewsk/Tonic) - autonomous car
  - [Lartpc2D](https://github.com/mmajewsk/gym-lartpc2d) - reinforcement learning
- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
  - Reading a lot on machine learning, and high energy physics
  - How to use VESC to build autonomous skateboard
- 👯 I’m looking to: collaborate on projects that apply ML & computer vision to the real world.
- 💬 Let's talk about: 
  - Machine Learning
  - Autonomous Cars
  - (High Energy) Physics
  - Python
- 📫 How to reach me: The best way is to reach me on [PyData Kraków discord channel](https://discord.gg/Pksa7n8)
- 👨‍🏫 I am also teaching a course called "Python in the Enterprise"
