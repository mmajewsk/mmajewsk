### Hi there 👋



- 🔭 I’m currently working on:
  - My Phd about Machine Learning for High Energy Physics
  - Some software for LHCb@CERN [Titania](https://gitlab.cern.ch/mmajewsk/titania) and [Storck](https://gitlab.cern.ch/mmajewsk/storck).
  - [Tonic](https://github.com/mmajewsk/Tonic) - autonomous car
  - [Lartpc2D](https://github.com/mmajewsk/gym-lartpc2d) - reinforcement learning
- 🌱 I’m currently learning
  - Reading a lot on machine learning, and high energy physics
  - How to use VESC to build autonomous skateboard
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects that apply ML & computer vision to the real world.
